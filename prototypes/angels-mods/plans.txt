-----Incompatibilities-----
Make everything load toghether
Make it so that it is playable, and not like steam power is locked behind auto science but you need steam enggines for collectors

-----tier 0 - pre science-----

start with stone furnace to make basic plates and player handcrafts basic bits to assemble crude parts needed to make proper equipment.
	need crude handcraft recipes that use extra materials and give scraps back with product

remove the ability to craft most recipes
	only leave final assembly of buildings and basic recipes

----tier 1 -----

add science pack that doesnt need any circuits using flask, 2 basic metals, Okarinome, and cellulose
	
	cellulose is the step after cellulose fibers

move water treatment, brown algae and paper to tier 1 pack

need to look into paper making - sodium hydroxide and the like

flask needs glass -- to get glass at start use crushed stone to make sand

replace crushed stone in angels ore crushing recipes with stone

stone -> crushed stone -> gravel -> sand -> pure sand
