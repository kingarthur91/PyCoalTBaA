	--((Science and tech changes))--

make early game sample analizer. see if i can borrow angels basic lab if industries isnt coming back soonish

it has so use those parts as they are not yet being used

rename sciences
	science 1 gets changed to astrobiology science pack
	add ground sample to science 1
	move recipes to game start
		- carbon dioxide from tar recipe
		- organic matter to carbon dioxide
		- green algae and algae farm? need unlocked
		- coarse faction needs a starter recipe
	
		
		make an exobiology tech 
			- realign farming to branch from exobiology
		move chlorine processing to t1

	--Science pack 2 changes
add seeded dish to science 2
replace ground sample with puffer eggs?, puffers?. some puffer related item

world gen changes
make changes so that getting a swamp tree is easyier or add a different way to get the needed seeds


	--((Automation changes))--
	
	all base game assembly machines will be limited to 1 ingrediant.
		might have to adjust this based on planned path and make it lvl 1 is 1. lvl 2 is 2 and lvl 3 is 3 ingrediants
	
	assembly machines will have energy source changes and automated factorys will have energy usage increased. base game ass 3 is at 375kw automated factory starts at 100kw for an extra .25 crafting speed
	
	assembly machine 1 will be steam powered and limited to 1 item tasks
	
	assembly machine 2 will come in 2 versions. 1 will be electric powered and require electric motors/engines. 2 will be gas (hydrocarbon most fuels) powered and require regular engines. 
	
		electric engines will tech will remove the prereq of regular motors as they are pretty much unrelated
			change around techs related to electric generation and transmission
				electric motors will be part of the first tech
					need to make a lub recipe availble early (probalbly from the farms)
				steam engines, py turbines and power equipment all fall under here
					nuclear and fusion will also branch off of here later in tree
					
	--(Fluids)--
	
	find all oil based fluids and sort out names and where they belong in the "distilation" tree
		naptha is duplicated and angels is a rename of petroleum gas
			petroleum gas icon is ethylene
			
			
	--(OIL CHANGES)--
	
	angel petrochem favors and handles natural gas and light crude oils
		change crude oil in angels recipes to light crude
	
	pycoal and pypetrohandling favor and handle heavy crude oils
		change crude oil in py recipes to heavy crude
		
		--(THINGS TO CHANGE)--
	--(light crude processing)--
		--TO MANY FOR OIL REFINERY--
		--SPILT INTO LIGHT DISTALLATES AND HEAVY DISTALLATES
	light crude oil -> lpg gases, light naptha, heavy naptha, kerosene, diesel, atmo gas oil, atmo bottoms
	
		--SPILT VERSION--
	light crude oil -> light distallates, kerosene, heavy distallates
	
	light distallates -> lpg gases, light naptha, heavy naptha
	
	heavy distallates -> diesel, atmo gas oil, atmo bottoms
	
	--DISTALLATES PRODUCTS--
	lpg gases -> fuel gas, lpg(i.e. propane), butane
	
	light naphtha , h2, clorinated alumina x 10 -> lpg gases, isomerate, clorinated alumina x 9
	
	heavy naphtha, h2 -> reformate, net h2
	
	atmo gas oil, light vac gas, h2 -> lpg gases, naphtha
	
		--(multiple uses for atmo bottoms)--
		--high tech method--
	atmo bottom -> light vac gas, heavy vac gas, vac residuals
		--low tech method--
	atmo bottom -> heavy fuel oil
	
	heavy vac gas, h2 -> lpg gases, hydrocracked gasoline, diesel, butane
	
	light vac gas, atmo gas oil, h2 -> lpg gases, ffc vac gas
	
	fcc vac gas -> lpg gases, naphtha, butane, fcc gas oil
	
	naphtha, h2 -> lpg gases, fcc gasoline
	
	vac residual, air -> asphalt
	
	vac residual -> lpg gases, coker naphtha, coker gas oil, coke
	
	fcc gas oil, coker gas oil -> fuel oil
	
	isomerate, reformate, hydrocracked gasoline, alkylate, fcc gasoline, coker naptha -> gasoline
	
	
	--(H2 SYNTHESIS)--
		might already be in here
	
	natural gas, steam -> co2, h2
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	--(ITEMS/ FLUIDS NEEDING MADE)--
	clorinated alumina - could also use angels aluminum cataylist
	
	--(list of hydrocarbons)--
	Ordered from highest to lowest hydrocarbon
	
	kerosene - c10-16
	gasoline - c4-12
	naptha - c4-12 - same level as gasoline but is used for heavy oil thining and higher octane fuel. lighter naptha isnt used in gasoline while heavyer naptha can be cracked into componets of gasoline. light is 6 or less. heavy 7+
	BTX - c6-12 - aromatics(benzene, toluene, xylenes - c6-8) carbon bonds are different from naptha and gasoline
	xylene - c8h10
	toluene - c7h8 - componet of gasoline
	benzene - c6h6 - not in gasoline
	
	
--(current recipes)--

oil refinery outputs
	mineral oil - just bunch of raw lubricants
	fuel oil - aka heating oil. heavy hydrocarbons only good for as "fuel"
	naptha - see above - cracked into gasoline
	
--(maybe petrochemicals)--

	need checked
